# Galaxies
In a Blazed Universe, galaxies are networks which are interconnected (meshed) and controlled by a central core controller (a "black hole"). 

## Black Hole
The Black Hole in a galaxy is its central authority, this zone is usually heavily foritified (especially at vunerable control points), and dense with data and routable endpoints. The black hole also contains various "dark" or "semi-dark" regions which may be partially or fully removed from the network. This allows for need-based data/zone access, and makes it easier to enforce a policy of minimum trust. Thus, customer and business data can be protected and fortified, and protected can be scaled based on specific need. The black hole may contain admin zones, CMS panels, and even employee software (such as CRM's and ERP's). 

## Solar System
A common group of domain-names (and/or IP addresses) is called a "solar system". A solar system is another boarder which allows multiple domain names and zones to be linked by shared patterns and sub-systems. Access control can also be implemented by the solar system to provide an added localization vector.

## Star
A root zone of routable domain or IP real-estate is called a "star". A zone of unroutable domain or IP real-estate is called a "nebula". A star offers its solar system: SSL/TLS authorization, email routing, DNSSec, Access control for zone (solar system), CDN for local zone (solar system) - for enforcing SAME ORIGIN policy (wherever possible), factories of data, root REST and HTML endpoints, network services (if applicable), service level authentication, databases, compute resources, 

## Planet
A sub-zone (subdomain) of routable (or unroutable) domain or IP real-estate is called a planet, or "world". A world has locations (nations, cities, towns, villages, etc.) which consist of a defined boundary of space (an application or "crust"), view and/or presenter logic (located in the "mantle"), the necessary logic to make it function properly (located at the "core"), local hosted static assets (objects), rate control/limiting (atmosphere), and is located within a greater network grid within a solar system, within a galaxy (blz://[GALAXY]/[SOLAR-SYSTEM]/[WORLD]/[LOCATION]).
